    "### A problem with using pandas  is that there are multiple ways to achieve a given result. Hence googling can introduce a random variability around the best way to achieve a result. Sometimes you hit a particular result and the next time for a very  similar query you get an entirely different way of doing it. For the newbie coder this can be confusing and also lead to the feeling that coding is a mysterious process which can only be googled!\n",

    "### Real world data wrangling can be challenging for those of us who are non coders. A common scenario after importing a data set is to stare at it blankly trying to recall what a particular code/syntax is for doing tasks which would take precisely a minute in Excel. Sometimes the tempatation is to finsh the entire data preperation phase in Excel and then import a clean data set to a Jupyter Notebook. Unfortunately this is only viable when the data set is small or moderate. Plus as a newbie coder it makes sense to do as many tasks as possible via coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I  then come to the second challenge of coding: googling the answer. Now, Google and Stackoverflow are great and frequently do provide the answers. But there is problem. Your coding skills will not evolve as one tends to 'copy paste' the code snippet without thinking about it at lenght. \n",
